        <h1>REJOICE</h1>
        <p>A Special Journey from Friendship to Something More</p>
            <p>
            I still remember the day we first talked—it felt so natural, like we had known each other forever. What started as simple conversations, laughter, and shared moments soon became something I truly cherish.
            </p><p>
            Over time, I realized that you weren’t just a friend—you were someone who made my days brighter, someone I looked forward to talking to, and someone who unknowingly became a big part of my life.
            </p><p>
            Lately, I’ve noticed that the way I feel about you has changed. It’s no longer just friendship—it’s something deeper, something real. I find myself thinking about you more, wanting to be there for you in ways I never thought about before.
</p><p>
            I don’t know where this journey will take us, but I do know one thing—I want to walk this path with you. No rush, no pressure, just two hearts figuring out something beautiful together.</p>

            <h1>From Friendship to Forever</h1>
           <p> We met like a whisper, a soft summer breeze,</p>
            <p> Two wandering souls, at ease, at peace.</p>
                <p> With laughter as light as the morning sky,</p>
                    <p>And words that danced, no need to try.</p>
            
                        <p>You were the smile on a cloudy day,</p>
                            <p> A quiet warmth that chose to stay.</p>
                                <p>Through endless talks and moments small,</p>
                                    <p>I never knew I'd start to fall.</p>
            
                                        <p> At first, just a friend, a hand to hold,</p>
                                            <p>A heart so gentle, yet pure and bold.</p>
                                                <p> But love, like seasons, slow and true,</p>
                                                    <p> Began to bloom where friendship grew.</p>
            
                                                        <p>I found you in sunsets, in songs unsung,</p>
                                                            <p>In late-night talks and air in my lungs.</p>
                                                                <p>A presence so steady, a comfort so bright,</p>
                                                                    <p> A star that glowed in my darkest night.</p>
            
                                                                        <p> Now here we stand, unsure yet strong,</p>
                                                                            <p> A melody waiting to be a song.</p>
                                                                                <p>No rush, no race, just hearts aware,</p>
                                                                                    <p>That something special lingers there.</p>
            
                                                                                        <p>So if this is love, let’s take it slow,</p>
                                                                                            <p>Let’s let the winds of wonder blow.</p>
                                                                                                <p>For you, my friend, are more than you see,</p>
                                                                                                    <p>You are the best kind of love to me.</p>
